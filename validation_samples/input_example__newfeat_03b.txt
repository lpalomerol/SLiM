#MUTATION TYPES  
m1 0.5 f  0.0 / neutral
m2 0.5 f  0.1 /positive selection
m3 0.5 f  0.2 /positive selection
m4 0.5 f  -0.1 /negative selection

#MUTATION RATE 
1e-9 

#GENOMIC ELEMENT TYPES 
/g1 m1 1.0 / only one type comprising the neutral mutations
/g2 m2 1.0 / only one type comprising the selective mutations
p1 g1 m1 0.5 m3 0.5
p1 g2 m1 0.5 m3 0.5
p2 g1 m2 0.5 m4 0.5
p2 g2 m2 0.5 m4 0.5


#CHROMOSOME ORGANIZATION 
g1 1 1 / g1 is length 1 bp
g2 2 2 / g2 is length 1 bp

#RECOMBINATION RATE 
3 2 /free recombination among the two positions

#GENERATIONS 
1000

#DEMOGRAPHY AND STRUCTURE 
1 P p1 500 / one population of 500 individuals means 1000 diploid sequences
1 P p2 500 / one population of 500 individuals means 1000 diploid sequences
2 M p2 p1 0.5 /migration and admixture to pop 1
2 M p1 p2 0.5 /migration and admixture to pop 2
3 M p2 p1 0.0 /now we cut admixture and see how the mutation evolve in the other population
3 M p1 p2 0.0 /now we cut admixture and see how the mutation evolve in the other population

#PREDETERMINED MUTATIONS
1 m1 1 p1 125 250 /p=0.5 in 500 individuals means 250 individuals Aa and 125 AA (A is the mutation)
1 m2 2 p2 125 250 /p=0.5 in 500 individuals means 250 individuals Aa and 125 AA (A is the mutation)

#OUTPUT 
1 T m1 /output trajectories for mutations of type m1
1 T m2 /output trajectories for mutations of type m2
1 T m3 /output trajectories for mutations of type m1
1 T m4 /output trajectories for mutations of type m2
