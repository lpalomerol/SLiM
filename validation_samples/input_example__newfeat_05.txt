#SEED
123

#MUTATION TYPES  
m1 0.5 f  0.0 / neutral
m2 0.5 f  0.1 /positive selection

#MUTATION RATE 
1e-9 

#GENOMIC ELEMENT TYPES 
/g1 m1 1.0 / only one type comprising the neutral mutations
/g2 m2 1.0 / only one type comprising the selective mutations
p1 g1 m1 1.0 /p1 only has neutral mutations
p1 g2 m1 1.0 /p1 only has neutral mutations
p2 g1 m2 1.0 /p2 only has selective mutations
p2 g2 m2 1.0 /p2 only has selective mutations

#CHROMOSOME ORGANIZATION 
g1 1 1 / g1 is length 1 bp
g2 2 2 / g2 is length 1 bp

#RECOMBINATION RATE 
3 2 /free recombination among the two positions

#GENERATIONS 
1000

#DEMOGRAPHY AND STRUCTURE 
1 P p1 500 / one population of 500 individuals means 1000 diploid sequences
1 P p2 500 / one population of 500 individuals means 1000 diploid sequences
2 M p2 p1 0.5 /migration and admixture to pop 1
2 M p1 p2 0.5 /migration and admixture to pop 2
3 M p2 p1 0.0 /now we cut admixture and see how the mutation evolve in the other population
3 M p1 p2 0.0 /now we cut admixture and see how the mutation evolve in the other population
/1 S p1 0 /in case sexed populations FORCE this option to zero automatically!
/1 S p2 0 /in case sexed populations FORCE this option to zero automatically!
3 T p1 10 /THRESHOLD only 10 males are used
3 T p2 2000 /THRESHOLD too high value, is not used
/3 R p1 0.1 /SEX RATIO sex ratio 0.1 males by 1.0 females at p1
/3 R p2 1.0 /SEX RATIO equal sex ratio at p2

#PREDETERMINED MUTATIONS
1 m1 1 p1 125 250 /p=0.5 in 500 individuals means 250 individuals Aa and 125 AA (A is the mutation)
1 m2 2 p2 125 250 /p=0.5 in 500 individuals means 250 individuals Aa and 125 AA (A is the mutation)

#OUTPUT 
1 T m1 /output trajectories for mutations of type m1
1 T m2 /output trajectories for mutations of type m2

#HERMAPHRODITES
0 /sexed species
